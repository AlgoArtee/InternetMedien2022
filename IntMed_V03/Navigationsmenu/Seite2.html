<h1>The hands of early graphic designers were guided by notions of the divine</h1>
As with so many early cultural works, the earliest (preserved) published works were often religious. Drawing, writing, and binding these books was time-consuming, 
so why waste these efforts on anything less than what came from above? Historical romances and self-help books would have to wait hundreds of years, when the publication 
bar would be much, much lower. <br><br>

The proto-graphic designers producing these texts didnâ€™t have formal training, but their work shows an incredible attention to visual harmony, and a deep awareness of 
the power of visuals to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. <br><br>

In the example from the Book of Kells below, created around 800 C.E. and containing the Four Gospels of the New Testament, we see both symmetry and balance. Grids are 
intuitive in laying out information and these early religious scholars had the innate sensibilities to arrange these holy texts following the grace of these invisible 
guidelines.<br><br>

We can go back even further. The ancient Egyptians followed what we call the Canon of Proportions. The figures depicted in their carvings and paintings followed this 
grid rule. The Egyptians based their canon of proportions as a human fist, measuring 18 fists from the ground to the forehead of a standing figure. Their hieroglyphics 
also show a distinct grid layout. Just imagine what these early creators working in stone could have done with CSS grid and flexbox!<br><br>

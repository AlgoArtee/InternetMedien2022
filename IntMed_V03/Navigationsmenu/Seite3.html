<h1>Breaking free from grids with the power of computers</h1>
Before computers, a graphic designer’s drawing table held X-acto knives, rubber cement, and 
tweezers. The process of placing type and visuals was a physical experience. Mistakes couldn’t 
be changed with a command from a computer keyboard.<br><br>

The advent of computers ushered in a whole new approach to design. Type could be replaced, 
borders shrunk or enlarged, and elements of a layout dragged to different spaces — all in an 
instant. And with this ease came a new appetite for experimentation. With this liberation from 
the constraints of physical media, the stakes were low to take chances with something new.<br><br>

The introduction of computers for design led to the California Graphic Design movement, which 
emerged in 1975. The movement brought avante-garde sensibilities only possible with the 
assistance of computers. Computers have helped designers shape their creative visions with a 
less time-consuming process. Today, it’s hard to imagine a world without their digital 
assistance.<br><br>

<h1>Grids will never go out of style</h1>
From prehistory to the 21st century, grids have guided so much in design. They make for a linear 
approach, where elements can be arranged with ease into a visually pleasing organization. 
Whether you're following a traditional layout or subverting to fit your own artistic 
sensibilities, they make for designs that are easy to understand and simple to navigate.<br><br>
